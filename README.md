## Intro
Please keep in mind, that what you see in this project is not what you should be doing _exactly_. And _always_.
It's more of a guideline, to grasp some ideas and them apply them in your real projects.
This project requires Javaâ„¢ 21.

Why don't you start with 

    ./mvnw test

### Task 1
Perhaps it's wiser to run slow tests only after fast tests pass?

Tests can be split logically in many ways, one of them is running them separately, e.g.

    ./mvnw test '-Dtest=!TestInt*' && ./mvnw test '-Dtest=TestInt*'

### Task 2
Perhaps the containers should start only once?

You can do that by making all `@Container` fields `static`. And making sure the state of the containers is cleaned between the tests.

### Task 3
Next, do we really need to start containers one by one?

Nope, we can make Testcontainers start containers in parallel: `@Testcontainers(parallel = true)`.

### Task 4
Wait, aren't we still starting containers too often?

Maybe a `static` block is even better than `static` fields.

### Task 5
Do we really need to run DB migrations before every test?

Nope, we can have a snapshot of the initial state in the container and simply restore it before next test.

### Task 6
What should we actually start with, before we start improving things?

Establishing a baseline. And we can use JFR for that.

### Task 7
Can we do something with the knowledge we have now?

Sure thing! We can squeeze more from our CPU (if we have more CPU)! How about

    ./mvnw test '-Dtest=TestInt*' -DforkCount=2

### Task 8
We squeezed the CPU. Can we squeeze the storage?

If not us, then who? (Linux only)

    .withTmpFs(Map.of("/var/lib/mysql", "rw")
    .withTmpFs(Map.of("/usr/share/elasticsearch/data", "rw"))

(This depends on your DB, of course.)

### Task 9
Do we have to run any migrations at all?

Not if we cache them between test runs.
Alternatively we could create custom image(s) and store them in local repo.
Please remember that existence of the cache means invalidation issues.

### Task 10
Can we reuse more than just DB snapshots?

Yes, we can [`.withReuse(true)`](https://java.testcontainers.org/features/reuse/) the whole containers!
(Don't forget though, that then you need to stop them manually, and it's not fork friendly.)
