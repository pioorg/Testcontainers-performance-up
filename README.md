## Intro
Please keep in mind, that what you see in this project is not what you should be doing _exactly_. And _always_.
It's more of a guideline, to grasp some ideas and them apply them in your real projects.
This project requires Javaâ„¢ 21.

Why don't you start with 

    ./mvnw test

### Task 1
Perhaps it's wiser to run slow tests only after fast tests pass?
